# Senior Project  ðŸš€

An all-in-one productivity app designed by students, for students. âœ¨ðŸ’°

I created this app as my senior proejct for the EFCTS Multimedia program. I wanted to branch out from the web development work I had done in the program so I chose to build a mobile app with React Native for my senior project. The overall senior project involved a creative pitch, meetings with mentors, progress update meetings, and a presentation to a panel of judges.
